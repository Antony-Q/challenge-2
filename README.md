## Challenge-02-Advanced CSS

Site Link: </a href="https://antony-q.github.io/challenge-2" >

This project was to test my CSS skills and knowledge, while also creating a starting point for what will become my professional portfolio to use when I apply for positions in the field, in the coming months.

The tasks that were required to be met were as follows:

- For a potential employer to sample my portfolio of previous work, I need to have a site that includes my name, a recent photo of myself, and links to various sections about myself, my work, and how to contact me.
- The links in the navigation bar need to make the UI scroll to the corresponding section
- The link to my work need s to make the UI scroll to the corresponding section with titled images of my applications
- When looking at the first application, the application's image should be larger in size than the others
- When the images are clicked, the user should be taken to that deployed application
- The page should be responsive and the layout should adapt to the users viewport on different devices

This project had no additional collaborators, so if there are any questions regarding the revisions that were made, please direct them to me at antonyq1992@github.com.
